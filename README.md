# OIBSIP Hello this is VISHAL MEHARWADE, under the internship of OASIS INFOBYTE.
TASK 1: IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION.

PROBLEM STATEMENT : The aim is to develop a model that can classify the iris flower into differnt species based on their sample and saple measurements.

In this project we can easily clean the given dataset and analyse using KNN classifier and build a model for training purpose.
Using KNN-Classifier we can obtain 100 percent of result.

Table of Contents:
1. Importing all the Libraries that is., required for the project.
2. Loading or Reading a file through ".csv" format.
3. Checking whether the dataset containing a null values or not.
4. Visualizing the data.
5. Data Processing.
6. Here we've used Label Encoder to transform the data.
7. Model selection KNN Classifier.
8. Splitting the Dataset
9. Training the model.
In the end, we obtain result.

Languages used : Python.
